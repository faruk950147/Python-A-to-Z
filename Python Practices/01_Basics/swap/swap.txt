what is swap
    swap is the process of exchanging the values of two variables.and it is used to swap the values of two variables.

Suppose we have:

x = 10
y = 20


We want to swap the values of x and y.

Your line of code:

x, y = y, x


means:

Python first looks at the right-hand side (y, x).

y is 20

x is 10
â†’ So it creates the tuple (20, 10).

Then Python assigns these values to the variables on the left-hand side:

x = 20

y = 10

ðŸ’¡ In short, x, y = y, x is just a shortcut to swap two variables without using a temporary variable.

Full example:

x = 10
y = 20

# swap
x, y = y, x

print(x)  # 20
print(y)  # 10
