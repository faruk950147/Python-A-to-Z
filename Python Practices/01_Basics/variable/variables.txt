A variable is basically a container or a named memory location that can store a value. Simply put, a variable is a name that holds some data which can change while the program runs.

For example, in Python:

age = 25
name = "Faruk"
height = 5.9


Here:

age is a variable that holds the value 25.

name is a variable that holds the value "Faruk".

height is a variable that holds the value 5.9.

Key points about variables:

You can choose the variable name (like x, score, total), but there are rules—for example, in Python, a variable name cannot start with a number.

The value of a variable can be changed:

age = 25
age = 26  # Now age is 26

Great! Let’s go over types of variables and how they are used in programming. I’ll use Python examples, but the concept is similar in most languages.

1. Integer (int)

Stores whole numbers (no decimal).

age = 25
year = 2025

2. Float (float)

Stores decimal numbers.

height = 5.9
price = 99.99

3. String (str)

Stores text, enclosed in quotes.

name = "Faruk"
city = 'Dhaka'

4. Boolean (bool)

Stores True or False.

is_student = True
has_passed = False

5. List

Stores multiple values in order (like an array).

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

6. Dictionary (dict)

Stores data as key-value pairs.

student = {"name": "Faruk", "age": 20, "city": "Dhaka"}

7. Variable Rules

Name must start with a letter or _ (underscore), not a number.

Names can contain letters, numbers, or _.

Cannot use Python keywords (like if, for, class).

Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age).

Tip: Variables are flexible. You can change their value anytime:

age = 25
age = 26  # Changed
