Input and Output are basic concepts in computer science and programming. Simply put:

Input:

The data or information you give to a computer or program to process.

Examples: typing a number on the keyboard, clicking the mouse, data from a file.

Programming example (Python):

name = input("Enter your name: ")  # user input


Output:

The result or information the computer or program gives back.

Examples: text displayed on the screen, printed report, data saved in a file.

Programming example (Python):

print("Hello,", name)  # output shown on screen


Simply:
Input = the data you give to the computer
Output = the result the computer gives you
