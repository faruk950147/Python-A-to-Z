Sure! In programming, an operator is a symbol that tells the computer to perform specific operations on one or more values (called operands) and produce a result.

Here’s a breakdown of the main types of operators in programming (using Python as an example):

1. Arithmetic Operators (Mathematical operations)

# ==================== operators ====================

+ : Addition → 5 + 3 = 8

- : Subtraction → 5 - 3 = 2

* : Multiplication → 5 * 3 = 15

/ : Division → 5 / 2 = 2.5

% : Modulus (remainder) → 5 % 2 = 1

** : Exponent → 2 ** 3 = 8

// : Floor division → 5 // 2 = 2

2. Comparison Operators (Compare values)

== : Equal → 5 == 5 → True

!= : Not equal → 5 != 3 → True

> : Greater than → 5 > 3 → True

< : Less than → 3 < 5 → True

>= : Greater than or equal → 5 >= 5 → True

<= : Less than or equal → 3 <= 5 → True

3. Logical Operators (Combine conditions)

and : True if both conditions are True → (5>3 and 2<4) → True

or : True if at least one condition is True → (5>3 or 2>4) → True

not : Reverses the result → not(5>3) → False

4. Assignment Operators (Assign values)

= : Assign → x = 5

+= : Add and assign → x += 3 → x = x + 3

-= : Subtract and assign → x -= 2 → x = x - 2

*= : Multiply and assign → x *= 2 → x = x * 2

/= : Divide and assign → x /= 2 → x = x / 2

5. Bitwise Operators (Operate on binary bits)

& : AND → 5 & 3 → 1

| : OR → 5 | 3 → 7

^ : XOR → 5 ^ 3 → 6

~ : NOT → ~5 → -6

<< : Left shift → 5 << 1 → 10

>> : Right shift → 5 >> 1 → 2

6. Membership Operators (Check presence in a container)

in : True if value is present → 'a' in 'apple' → True

not in : True if value is not present → 'b' not in 'apple' → True

7. Identity Operators (Check object identity)

is : True if both refer to the same object → x is y

is not : True if both refer to different objects → x is not y

8. Special Operators (Other operations)

is : True if both refer to the same object → x is y

is not : True if both refer to different objects → x is not y

# ==================== operator and operand ====================

An operand is simply the value or variable that an operator acts upon.

Think of it this way: in the expression:

5 + 3


+ is the operator (it tells Python to add).

5 and 3 are the operands (the numbers being added).

Another example with variables:

x = 10
y = 5
z = x * y


* is the operator (multiplication).

x and y are the operands.

So basically:

Operator → the action
Operand → the data the action is performed on


# ==================== operator precedence and associativity ====================

In programming, operator precedence and associativity determine the order in which expressions are evaluated.

1. Precedence 

Precedence decides which operator gets applied first in an expression with multiple operators.

Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

Example:

result = 2 + 3 * 4


* has higher precedence than +, so multiplication happens first:
3 * 4 = 12 → then 2 + 12 = 14

If you want addition first, you must use parentheses:

result = (2 + 3) * 4  # 5 * 4 = 20

2. Associativity 

Associativity decides the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.

Most operators are left-to-right associative, some are right-to-left.

Example (Left-to-Right):

result = 10 - 5 - 2


- has the same precedence. Associativity is left-to-right.

So, (10 - 5) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3

Example (Right-to-Left):

result = 2 ** 3 ** 2


** (exponent) is right-to-left associative.

So, 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 2 ** 9 = 512

Precedence → Which operator goes first.

Associativity → Which way to evaluate when multiple operators have the same precedence.

# operator and operand
# operator = + # operator is an operator 
# operand = 10 # operand is a value

# operator precedence and associativity
# operator precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated
# associativity is the order in which operators are evaluated
