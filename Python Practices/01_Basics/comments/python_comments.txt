Python Comments

In Python, a comment is text in the code that the interpreter completely ignores during execution.
Comments are only used for explanation, documentation, or notes so that programmers can better understand the code.

1. Single-line Comment

Used for a single line.
It starts with #.

# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # assigning a value to the variable
print(x)  # output will be shown here

2. Multi-line Comment (Docstring style / Triple quotes)

To write comments spanning multiple lines, you can use ''' ... ''' or """ ... """.

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It is usually used for long explanations or documentation.
"""
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

3. Docstring (Function/Module/Class Documentation)

When """ ... """ or ''' ... ''' is used inside a function, class, or module, it is called a docstring.
This is used for documentation and can be viewed with help().

def add(a, b):
    """
    This function returns the sum of two numbers.
    Parameters:
        a (int/float): first number
        b (int/float): second number
    Returns:
        int/float: sum
    """
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))
print(help(add))  # docstring will be displayed here
