# ======================= Loops =======================

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that let you repeat a set of instructions multiple times until a certain condition is met. In simple words, loops help you run the same code again and again without writing it multiple times.

In Python, there are mainly two types of loops:

1. for loop

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, or range.

Example:

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
3
4
5

2. while loop

A while loop runs as long as a condition is True.

Example:

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1  # increase i by 1 each time


Output:

1
2
3
4
5


Important points:

If the condition never becomes false, the loop will run forever — this is called an infinite loop.

You can use break to stop a loop early.

You can use continue to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.



# ======================= Looping in sequences =======================

1. for loop

Used to iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges).

# Example: print numbers 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
3
4
5


Iterating over a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


Output:

apple
banana
cherry

# Example: print fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in range(len(fruits)):
    print(fruits[fruit])


Output:

apple
banana
cherry

2. while loop

Runs as long as a condition is True.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


Output:

1
2
3
4
5

3. Loop control statements

break → stop the loop immediately

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)


Output:

1
2


continue → skip the current iteration

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
4
5

Use for when you know how many times you want to repeat.

Use while when you want to repeat until a condition changes.
