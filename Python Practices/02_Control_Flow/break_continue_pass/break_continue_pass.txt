Here’s the explanation of break, continue, and pass in English with examples:

1. break

break completely stops the loop.
As soon as the condition is met, the loop ends immediately.

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

2. continue

continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
The loop does not stop, only the current iteration is ignored.

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5

3. pass

pass does nothing.
It’s just a placeholder when you need a statement syntactically but don’t want to execute anything.

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5


In short:

break → exits the loop

continue → skips current iteration

pass → does nothing (placeholder)
