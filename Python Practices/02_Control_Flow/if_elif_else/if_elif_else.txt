if-elif-else in Python is a decision-making statement that lets your program choose different actions based on conditions.

How it works:

if → checks the first condition.

elif → (short for “else if”) checks another condition if the previous if was false.

else → runs if all previous conditions are false.

Example:
x = 15

if x > 20:
    print("x is greater than 20")
elif x == 20:
    print("x is exactly 20")
else:
    print("x is less than 20")


Output:

x is less than 20


Summary:

if → first condition

elif → additional condition

else → default if all conditions fail
