switch-case is a conditional structure in programming that lets you select and execute one block of code from multiple possible cases. Simply put, it’s similar to if-elif-else, but it’s cleaner and easier to read when you have many conditions.

General structure (like in C/C++/Java):

match (expression):
    case value1:
        # code to execute if expression == value1
    case value2:
        # code to execute if expression == value2
    default:
        # code to execute if no case matches


Example:

int day = 3;

match(day):
    case 1:
        print("Monday");
    case 2:
        print("Tuesday");
    case 3:
        print("Wednesday");
    default:
        print("Invalid day");


Here, day is 3, so the output will be:

Wednesday


Note: If you omit break, the program will continue executing the following cases as well.

In Python, there is no direct switch-case, but you can do something similar with if-elif-else or dictionaries.

Example 1: Using if-elif-else

day = 3

if day == 1:
    print("Monday")
elif day == 2:
    print("Tuesday")
elif day == 3:
    print("Wednesday")
else:
    print("Invalid day")


Example 2: Using a dictionary (Pythonic way)

day = 3

match = {
    1: "Monday",
    2: "Tuesday",
    3: "Wednesday"
}

print(match.get(day, "Invalid day"))


The get() method allows us to set a default value (Invalid day) if no case matches.

In Python 3.10+, you can also use the match-case statement, which works very similar to C/Java’s switch-
