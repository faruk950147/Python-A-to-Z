1. Set Name and Email (only once after installation)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"


Check your configuration:

git config --list

2. Create a New Project
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
echo "<h1>Hello GitHub</h1>" > index.html
echo "# My First GitHub Project" > README.md


Now your project has two files – index.html and README.md.

3. Initialize Git
git init


This makes the folder a Git repository.

4. Check Status
git status


This will show which files are new or not added yet.

5. Stage Files
git add index.html
git add README.md
# Or to add all files at once:
git add .

6. Commit Files
git commit -m "First commit: Added index.html and README.md"


Commit = local save. Git keeps snapshots/history of your work.

7. Create GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub → click New Repository → give it a name, e.g., myproject.
The repo URL will look like:

https://github.com/username/myproject.git

8. Connect Local Repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git


Replace username with your GitHub username.

9. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main      # set branch name to main (if needed)
git push -u origin main


Now your project is uploaded to GitHub.

Daily Workflow (Everyday Usage)

When you make changes in your project:

git status                   # see what changed
git add .                    # stage all changes
git commit -m "Update work"  # commit changes
git push origin main         # push to GitHub

Clone Others’ Repositories
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git


This downloads a project to your PC.

Get Updates (Pull)

If someone else updated the GitHub repo, you can sync:

git pull origin main
